        <h2>NOTABLE ACHIEVEMENTS</h2>
        <h3>Designed, built and piloted a custom pod racer. 32 BBY Boonta
            Eve Classic Race Champion.
        </h3>
        <p>In my spare time at Wald's Parts junk shop I designed and built a Class
            III open cockpit Podracer capable of 588 mph top speed. Went on to 
            win the Boonta Eve Classic race in 32 BBY - first ever win by a human.
            Generated documented company revenue of over 59 wupiupi during the
            course of my enslavement</p>

        <h3>Oversight of DS1 and DS2 Orbital Battle Stations construction projects</h3>
        <p>During my tenure as a Supreme Imperial Fleet Commander I was charge large
            capital construction projects for the Deep Space Fleet. Performed acceptance
            testing of the DS1 SuperLaser in O BBY by annihilating, Alderaan - a terrestrial
            class planet in the Core Worlds region. Successfully tripled the deep space fire
            power of the imperial fleet in accordance with the Tarkin Doctrine before losing
            both projects to run-away photon torpedoes.
